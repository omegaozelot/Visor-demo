# Visor
Major project.



### Instructions

Create an anaconda (Jupyter) environment with Python version `3.8.13`.

In order to get the website up and running, run all cells in the app.ipynb file first, then wait until this comes up after the last cell:

```python
* Serving Flask app '__main__' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
```



Make sure that node.js is installed on the computer. Then do `node server.js` in this directory (right-click this folder, open in terminal, run the command).
