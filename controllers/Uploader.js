The project involves four multilevel escape rooms to help users learn about malware, as well as a simple futuristic themed MEC to be distributed to visitors as a secondary option. The business impacts of the project include being cost effective, improving efficiency, and raising awareness and exposure.",
            transcript: "Good morning or good afternoon everyone. My name is James and I'll be talking about my major project which is based on 3D Mwa and MA interactive environment, business problems slash challenges. The first business problem or challenge is meeting the users' needs when our user plays our game environment, some of them may already have information or knowledge about malware beforehand or some may not. This will make it hard to satisfy the users' needs and some may find the information too lacking or some find it too excessive. We decided to solve this issue by letting test users test our environments to let them provide feedback. This will allow us to get user feedback which will let us know where to improve. In turn meeting the users' needs relevance to game elements and educational value would be the next business problems as users may feel demotivated to play. If the game element is low or on the other hand, if the game educational value is too low, the user won't learn much. This makes it hard to find a proper balance. However, this can be solved by also getting user feedback, we know that this may not meet all user needs as the sample size is low. The third business problem is marketing in an unsaturated marketplace. Since educational malware games are not very common, this sort of market will be hard to advertise. Furthermore, the target audience will be low since this will only interest a small percentage of people which may not make the game profitable but more for spreading awareness or the the solutions for the solutions slash findings of the project. We are spreading awareness due to lack of malware awareness due to the lack of due to the ever advancing more of technology, much data is stored online. However many people still do not know about the risks that are involved. For example, ill intent users may use malicious programs or AWAS to steal users personal information for their own game. Hence, we decided to create a 3d immersive environment where we will focus on four multilevel escape rooms for users to partake this will help users to learn more about malware through the escape rooms. The rules will also be each on a different topic such as types of malware and types of attacks. Secondly, we also hope to raise recognition for T PM malware analysis center M AC for short, since circumstances may occur such as COVID lockdown or our M AC staff not being available. We decided to create a simple futuristic themed mec that can be distributed to our visitors as a secondary option for a brief online tour around a futuristic M AC. This will in turn also help to increase recognition for our for our awareness center business impacts the first business impact will be on cost. This project business impact cost will be cheap as developers are students. This will mean that the platform used by students in this case, which is UN T 3D will be free. This will lower cost me in turn saving money. The second business impact will be efficiency. Since the project will be done by students in the cybersecurity course, we will already have retaining information about malware. We will only then need to learn from scratch how to create a game environment. Although this will be tough, this will let us learn new things and improve ourselves. This can be applicable in a real environment such by when the company starts, improves and learn new things. The company will also improve overall last but not least the third business impact will be about spreading awareness or exposure. Since we decided to include the TP MS C, this project can also showcase and give exposure to our mec by giving a simple tour in our game environment. This can increase thematic police recognition. On the other hand, this project will also raise awareness about malware's and lead to public benefit and branding, which will also help more people to know more about T PM EC as well as malware. With that, we'll come to the end of the presentation. Thank you"

            summary: `Push Power Matrix, a student with the matrix number 2100840D, presented their final-year project aimed at assisting overworked teachers. The project involves a website designed to help teachers mark assignments more consistently and efficiently, thus saving time. The primary users are teachers and educators, but the website can be used across multiple sectors on campus. Key features of the website include:<br><br><ul class="smallul"><li><b>Hume SDK Detection:</b> Presumably for emotion analysis or user behavior insights.</li><li><b>AWS Transcribe:</b> For converting speech to text.</li><li><b>GPT-3:</b> For generating human-like text, potentially for providing feedback or summarizing content.</li><li><b>Gaze Estimation:</b> Likely used to assess attention or engagement.</li><li><b>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</b> For understanding and processing human language.</li><li><b>Tone Analysis:</b> To gauge the sentiment or emotional tone of the speech or text.</li><li><b>Picture Detection:</b> Possibly for recognizing and processing images within the assignments.</li><li><b>Final PDF Report:</b> To summarize the analyzed and processed work into a cohesive report.</li></ul>The project aims to streamline the grading process, thereby alleviating the workload of teachers and ensuring consistency in marking.`,
            transcript: "Hi. My name is Push Power Matrix number 2100840 D. And I'm presenting my visor project. Yes. The background of this project is that because teachers these days are overwhelmed and overworked. So basically what we are trying to is you are trying to provide a helping hand to these teachers to allow them to be able to mark more consistently and save a lot of their time. So like the users are obviously the teachers and educators of our school of the body. And also this website can be used throughout campus in multiple sectors. As long as students record an MP video for teachers to mark. The features of our website is hume SDK detection, AWS, transcribe GPT three gaze estimation, natural language processing and tone analysis along with picture detection and the final PDF report so that you can see the summarized work"
